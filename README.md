> This is our tech talk on the project, including highlights on converting the LiDAR dataset into an open standard format, visualizing it in an open source way for the *first time ever* and challenges we faced to make it happen. It also includes potential next steps for the project.

##### [LIVE ON GLITCH](https://berry-vaulted-exoplanet.glitch.me/)
> Check out our live version of this project on Glitch. You can interact with 1,000 frames of point cloud data collected from Lyft's Level 5 open dataset. Each frame in our visualization was converted into an open standard format which makes it easier to view across existing 3D visualization platforms. Click here to see how our car model navigates it in a 3D geospatial arena (using the [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/cesiumjs/) library).
